2. Profitability Analysis
Description: Deep dive into revenue streams and cost centers to identify profitability drivers.

    Metrics:

    - Gross/Net profit margins by product, region, channel
    - Contribution margin analysis
    - Break-even point calculation
    - Customer/product profitability ranking

3. Time Series Trend
Description: Advanced time-based pattern recognition and visualization.

    Features:

    - Seasonality detection
    - Moving averages (7-day, 30-day, quarterly)
    - Year-over-year comparison
    - Trend decomposition (trend, seasonal, residual)

4. Top Performers
